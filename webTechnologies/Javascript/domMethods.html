    <h3>DOM Manipulation</h3>

    <p>The DOM represents a web page as a hierarchical, tree-like structure and we can use Javascript methods to manipulate underlying HTML elements of the page in order to create powerful effects.</p>

    <h4>Nodes</h4>

    <p>The document tree is a collection of nodes, with each of the branches and leaves on the tree represented by a node. There are a number of different types of node:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Element Nodes</dt>

      <dd>HTML tags e.g. &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;body&gt; are represented by element nodes within the DOM.</dd>

      <dt>Text Nodes</dt>

      <dd>The text within an element, e.g. the text of a paragraph within the &lt;p&gt; tags are represented as text nodes. In HTML, text nodes must be enclosed within element nodes, but element nodes do not have to contain text e.g. the &lt;img&gt; tag.</dd>

      <dt>Attribute Nodes</dt>

      <dd>Attributes of HTML tags e.g. title or src are represented by Attribute Nodes.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>We can use DOM methods to manipulate these nodes.</p>

    <h3>DOM methods</h3>

    <p>Finding Nodes</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>getElementById</dt>

      <dd>Takes argument: an id. Returns: the element with that id. It can only be called on the document object.</dd>

      <dt>getElementsByTagName</dt>

      <dd>Takes argument: the name of a tag. Returns: an array of all the elements with that tag name.</dd>

      <dt>hasChildNodes</dt>

      <dd>Returns true if the element on which it is called has any child nodes.</dd>

      <dt>childNodes</dt>

      <dd>Returns an array of all the children of the element on which it is called.</dd>

      <dt>firstChild</dt>

      <dd>Returns the first child of the element on which it is called.</dd>

      <dt>lastChild</dt>

      <dd>Returns the last child of the element on which it is called.</dd>

      <dt>nextSibling</dt>

      <dd>Returns the next node of the element on which it is called. Or null.</dd>

      <dt>parentNode</dt>

      <dd>Returns the parent node of the element on which it is called. Or null.</dd>

      <dt>previousSibling</dt>

      <dd>Returns the previous node of the element on which it is called. Or null.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>These methods are applied within the current scope of the document. So you can find a given element within a document using getElementById, and then use getElementsByTagName to return all the given tags just within that elements scope in the document.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>getAttribute</dt>

      <dd>Takes argument: the name of an attribute. Returns: value of that attribute or null if no value is set. It can only be called on an element node.</dd>

      <dt>setAttribute</dt>

      <dd>Takes arguments: an attribute name, the value that you wish to set for that attribute.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Nodes can also be created, inserted, removed and replaced</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>createElement</dt>

      <dd>Takes argument: the name of the element to be created and returns the new element.</dd>

      <dt>createTextNode</dt>

      <dd>Takes argument: the text to be added. Returns: a new text node containing the specified text. This new text node is not automatically added to the document - you need to use node manipulation methods to insert or append the new node, or replace an existing node.</dd>

      <dt>appendChild</dt>

      <dd>Takes a node as an argument and appends this node as the last child of the element on which it is called. It returns the appended node.</dd>

      <dt>insertBefore</dt>

      <dd>Takes two arguments: the new node and the target node. It inserts the new node before the target node on within the element on which it is called. It returns the new node.</dd>

      <dt>removeChild</dt>

      <dd>It takes a node as an argument and removes this node, and all of its children, from the element on which it is called. It returns a reference to the node that has been removed.</dd>

      <dt>replaceChild</dt>

      <dd>This takes two arguments: the new node and the old node. It replaces the old node with the new node within the element on which it is called. It returns the old node.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>You can also access the properties of nodes within the document tree.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>nodeName</dt>

      <dd>Returns a string containing the name of the node on which it is called</dd>

      <dt>nodeType</dt>

      <dd>Returns an integer value that corresponds to the type of the node on which it is called.</dd>

      <dt>nodeValue</dt>

      <dd>Returns the value of the node on which it is called.</dd>
    </dl>
